# Project
This project uses Expo. To install and run it properly, see [Expo installation Guides](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).
To run and build local codebase, the team uses the [Expo Go App](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-ios-and).

# Install dependencies
Run to install local dependencies on `node_modules` and install `expo-cli` globally.
```
npm i
npm install --global expo-cli
```
- it's also required to install the Android SDK in your default environment. Ideally, set to a `{yourPath}\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` directory. 

# Testing
The test files are stored along their testing components, as in
```
/src/components/form/LoginForm.tsx // a React component, along
/src/components/form/LoginForm.test.tsx // it's test suite file
```
The current test-runner is `jest-expo`. To run all test suites, run
```
npm test
```
# Running
Run this command to start tunnel mode.
```
npm run start-tunnel
```
Afterwards, scan the generated QR Code with your Expo GO App
